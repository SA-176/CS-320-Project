# CS-320-Project Steven Anderson

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  To ensure that my project is functional and secure I can run static and functional testing to ensure the program both runs as it needs to and is free of vulnerabilities and weakness. Such as using the JUnit testing to make sure the program passes what it needs to. I can also use similar methods for other languages with systems of checks to make sure the program passes and fails what it needs to. 
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  When interpreting user needs it is importanty to make sure I log what the client needs and put them in order of importance for both the project and for the client. Going in with a list of questions that help get the information is always helpful. Once you have list of the needs of the program you can form a development plan and ask the client if they notice anything you are missing. Using the development plan and making a timeline for time mangagement and breaking it down into groupings will also ensure all of the user needs are incorporated. 
  
How do I approach designing software?
  I approach software like I'm setting up for a building project. I first organize what I need to do and what is required to get it done. I also try and approximate how much time I will need to code the program. With that I make a development plan with a timeline. Included in my development plan is how many file and what file types I will need and how many I will need. I also as I develop form questions and tests to help make sure I keep the program working the way it is supposed to.
